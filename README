jWatermark
==========

- Introdction -
-----------
jWatermark is a Java based tool to mark watermark on image and output as JPEG format.

The GUI part is based on the Standard Widget ToolkitStand (SWT). SWT is a graphical widget toolkit for use with the Java platform and it is written in Java. To display GUI elements, the SWT implementation accesses the native GUI libraries of the operating system using JNI (Java Native Interface) in a manner that is similar to those programs written using operating system-specific APIs. Programs that call SWT are portable, but the implementation of the toolkit, despite the fact that part of it is written in Java, is unique for each platform.

SWT is chosen instead of Swing because the interface looks more native and more responsive in SWT. However, it should be easy for a Swing port.

- Build -
-----------
Requirments:
Java 1.5 or above (tested for Java 5 and 6)

SWT (tested 3.4 and 3.7)
Download: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/
1. Open eclipse
2. File -> Import -> "Existing Projects into Workspace" -> "Select archieve file" -> select the swt.zip downloaded
3. By default the SWT JAR will be placed in {workspace}\org.eclipse.swt\swt.jar

- JVM args -
-----------
suggest to enlarge the memory for the JVM for processing image
java -Xms64M -Xmx512m -Xmn32M -XX:PermSize=64M -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -jar watermark.jar jwatermark.Main

- TODO -
-----------
1. add a wrapper for starting the program with appropriate JVM args
2. Store platform dependency settings in properties files
3. i18n for interface
